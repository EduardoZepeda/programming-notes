## 1.6 Charging

In any case the fee is per work done, if the client wants also to add a
domain name and a hosting a extra fee should be charged. It is
convenient to upload the site to a test site so the client can see it
working, and then upload it to the permanent hosting.

-   Per hour
-   Per flat rate
-   Retainer

### 1.6.1 Per hour

Not recommended if you\'re new, because the client doesn\'t know how
good you are. Except when you\'re modifying a small part of a project.
Warning: When you choose an hourly rate you will probably not be able to
increase the hourly rate later, take in account the number of hours.

### 1.6.2 Per flat rate

The best option

### 1.6.3 Retainer

When the client needs monthly mainteinment

### 1.2.1 Achievable development Plan

### 1.2.2 Prioritizing with the customer

### 1.2.3 Defining Iterations

### 1.2.4 VELOCITY- Productive time

Velocity is how fast your team can work, but we need to see it as a
potential time, not full time. You need to take in account sickness,
events, etc.

### 1.2.5 Backlog

A big board used to show the pending, in progress and done tasks. It can
be virtual, like monday, trello, jira and similar apps.

Try to reach it ASAP, and try to iterate one time per month.
